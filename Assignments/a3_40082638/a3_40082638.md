#### PROBLEM 1. Let A and B be sets. Prove that $A \subseteq B$ if and only if $P(A) \subseteq P(B)$.

Power set is the set of all subsets of a given set, $S$
By definition, if $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, then all subsets of $A$ are also subsets of $B$.

$A = \{a\}$
$P(A) = \{\{\}, \{a\}\}$

$B = \{a, b\}$
$P(B) = \{\{\}, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}\}$

$\therefore$ $A \subseteq B \iff P(A) \subseteq P(B)$  must be true.

#### PROBLEM 2. Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be sets. Prove or disprove the following: $(A ∩ B) ∪ (C ∩ D) ≡ (A ∩ D) ∪ (C ∩ B)$.
$\text{Let }A = \{1\}$
$\text{Let }B = \{1, 2\}$
$\text{Let }C = \{3,4,5\}$
$\text{Let }D = \{5,6,7,8\}$

$(A ∩ B) = \{1\}$
$(C ∩ D) = \{5\}$
$(A ∩ B) ∪ (C ∩ D) = \{1,5\}$

$(A ∩ D) = \{\}$
$(C ∩ B) = \{\}$
$(A ∩ D) ∪ (C ∩ B) = \{\}$

$\{1,5\} \neq \{\}$

> $\therefore (A ∩ B) ∪ (C ∩ D) \neq (A ∩ D) ∪ (C ∩ B)$

#### PROBLEM 3. Give an example of two uncountable sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A – B$ is 
#####(a) Countably Infinite. 
$\text{Let } A = \text{The set of real numbers}$
$\text{Let } B = \text{The set of irrational numbers}$

$\therefore A-B = \text{The set of rational numbers}$

##### (b) Uncountable.
$\text{Let } A = \text{The set of complex numbers}$
$\text{Let } B = \text{The set of real numbers}$

$\therefore A-B = \text{The set of imaginary numbers}$

#### PROBLEM 4. Prove that $⌊3x⌋ = ⌊x⌋ + ⌊x + 1/3⌋ + ⌊x + 2/3⌋$.

Case 1: $x < 1/3$
$⌊3(1/4)⌋ = ⌊1/4⌋ + ⌊1/4 + 1/3⌋ + ⌊1/4 + 2/3⌋$
$⌊0⌋ = 0 + 0 + 0$
$0 = 0$

Case 2: $x = 1/3$
$⌊3(1/3)⌋ = ⌊1/3⌋ + ⌊1/3 + 1/3⌋ + ⌊1/3 + 2/3⌋$
$⌊1⌋ = 0 + 0 + 1$
$1 = 1$

Case 3: $1/3 < x < 2/3$
$⌊3(1/2)⌋ = ⌊1/2⌋ + ⌊1/2 + 1/3⌋ + ⌊1/2 + 2/3⌋$
$⌊1⌋ = 0 + 0 + 1$
$1 = 1$

Case 4: $x = 2/3$
$⌊3(2/3)⌋ = ⌊2/3⌋ + ⌊2/3 + 1/3⌋ + ⌊2/3 + 2/3⌋$
$⌊2⌋ = 0 + 1 + 1$
$2 = 2$

Case 5: $2/3 < x < 1$
$⌊3(3/4)⌋ = ⌊3/4⌋ + ⌊3/4 + 1/3⌋ + ⌊3/4 + 2/3⌋$
$⌊2⌋ = 0 + 1 + 1$
$2 = 2$

Case 6: $x > 1$
$⌊3(2)⌋ = ⌊2⌋ + ⌊2 + 1/3⌋ + ⌊2 + 2/3⌋$
$⌊6⌋ = 2 + 2 + 2$
$6 = 6$

$\therefore$ this holds for all values of $x$.

#### PROBLEM 5. 
##### (a) Give an example of a function from $\Z^+$ to $\Z^+$ that is neither one-to-one nor onto.
$f(x) = (x-2)^2$
$f(1) = 1$
$f(3) = 1$

Since we have an $x$ and a $y$ value that produce the same output, we know that this is not a one-to-one relationship. Since 3 exists in the domain of both, however cannot be produced by f(x), it is therefore also not an onto relationship.

##### (b) Let $g : A ⟶ B$ and $f : B ⟶ C$ be functions. Let $f ∘ g$ be onto. Are both $f$ and $g$ necessarily onto?



##### (c) Let $f$ be a function from $\R$ to $\R$ defined by $f(x) = x^2$. Find $f^{–1}(\{x | 0 < x < 1\})$.

#### PROBLEM 7. Let $a$, $b$, and $m$ be integers, and $m ≥ 2$. Prove that $ab ≡ [ (a \mod m) · (b \mod m) ] \mod m$.

#### PROBLEM 8. Prove that $a^3 ≡ a\mod 3$ for every positive integer a.
$\text{let } A(x) = x^3 ≡ x (\mod 3)$
Base case: $A(1) = 1 ≡ 1 \mod 3 = 0$

Inductive step: $(x+1)^3 ≡ (x+1) \mod 3$
$(x+1)^3 - (x+1)$
$(x+1)(x+1)(x+1) - (x+1)$
$(x^2+2x+1)(x+1) - (x+1)$
$(x^3+x^2+2x^2+2x+x+1) - (x+1)$
$x^3+x^2+2x^2+2x+x+1-x+1$
$x^3+x^2+2x^2+2x+x-x$
$(x^3-x) + 3(x^2+x)$ 

Since $(x^3-x) + 3(x^2+x)$ is divisible by $3$, we know $x^3 ≡ x (\mod 3)$ holds for every interger a, $\therefore$ the original claim holds true as well.
