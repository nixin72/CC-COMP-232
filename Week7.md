Division

Let a, b, and c be integers, where a != 0. 

if a | b and a | c then a | (b + c)
if a | b, then a | bc then for all integers c;
if a | b and b | c then a | c

**Proof** suppose a|b and a|c, then it follows that there are integers s and t with b = as and c = at. Hence, 

b + c = as + as = a(s + t). Hence, a | (b + c)

Crollary if a, b and c be integers, where a != 0, such that a | b and a | c, then a | mb + nc whenever m and n are integers.
